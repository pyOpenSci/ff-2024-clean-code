# 2024 pyOpenSci Fall Festival: Clean Code Workshop 

This GitHub repo contains lessons taught in the 2024 Fall Festival Clean Code workshop. If you want to work on these lessons online, you 
can open the repo using the binder link below

[![Binder](https://binder.opensci.2i2c.cloud/badge_logo.svg)](https://binder.opensci.2i2c.cloud/v2/gh/pyopensci/ff-2024-clean-code/HEAD)

## What is pyOpenSci?

pyOpenSci is devoted to building diverse, supportive community around
the Python open source tools that drive open science. We do this through:

* open peer review
* mentorship
* training

pyOpenSci is an independent organization, fiscally sponsored by Community
Initiatives.

## Important Things to Understand when using Binder

1. **Important**: Binder is a service that provides a **temporary** instance for your work. It does not save your work for you.
   If you close your browser, your work will not persist.
2. **Tip**: To make sure you have a persistent copy of your notebook, you should **download** it periodically. The
   download button is convenient and shown below:

It will take 15-60 seconds to build a workspace in the cloud for you. When Binder has finished loading, you will see the following Jupyter Lab workspace:

- On the left is the file navigation sidebar where you will find the activities.
- On the right is the Jupyter Notebook interface.
- Reminder: Shift+Enter key combination or the play button will run a notebook cell.

## Gratitude

Thank you to [2i2c](https://2i2c.org/) and NASA for providing a Binder instance that we can use for workshops.
We're grateful for the work that they are doing to support open learning and discovery.
