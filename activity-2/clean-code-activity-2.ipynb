    "## The clean code strategies \n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, you will focus on the following clean code strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Document:** Document what the code does by adding a docstring at the top of the script to help your future self, a future lab member, or another user understand your code's tasks. Use Numpy-style docstrings when possible. \n",
    "* **Modularize** Make your code more modular by adding functions that perform small, repeated tasks. Functions should also have docstrings and expressive names for added readability and usability.\n",
    "* **Use Loops** Eliminate repetition by using loops that will iterate over specific tasks. In this case, you will iterate over processing several files. \n",
    "* **Create dynamic paths:** Dynamic paths ensure that your code will run on other machines regardless of operating system. To achieve this in Python, you can use `os` or `pathlib` to create paths\n",
    "\n",
    "## To begin - identify redundant parts of this code \n",
    "\n",
    "Create pseudocode (or text) describing the process steps represented in the code below. How could the code be organized differently and more efficiently? \n",
    "\n",
    "What tools could make the code more DRY?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reproducibility: will your code run on other machines?\n",
    "\n",
    "When considering workflow reproducibility, ensuring that your code runs seamlessly across different machines is important. Hard-coded paths (e.g., `data\\part-1-data.json`) can cause errors. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The path `data/part-1-data.json` is a POSIX path, which works on Mac and Linux machines but will fail on Windows because Windows uses backslashes (`\\`) for paths.\n",
    "* Similarly, a path like `data\\part-1-data.json`, written for Windows, will fail on Mac and Linux systems, which expect forward slashes (`/`) in their paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid these issues, file paths should be constructed dynamically using tools like Python’s `pathlib`. Using `pathlib` will ensure path compatibility across different operating systems by automatically using the correct path format for the system on which your code is running.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{tip} \n",
    "* “POSIX” refers to a set of standards for maintaining compatibility between operating systems, and Mac systems are POSIX-compliant.\n",
    "* You can also use `os.path.join` to create paths; however, using `pathlib` is a more modern and flexible approach. \n",

When using `.apply()`, you can specify whether the function should be applied across columns (`axis=0`, the default) or across rows (`axis=1`).\n",
